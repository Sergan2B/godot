# Godot × Codex integration documents

This directory is the authoritative entry point for the Godot × Codex integration. Product scope is defined before implementation details; implementation documents may refine a contract but must not silently weaken a parent invariant.

## Reading order

1. [MASTER_SPRINT_ROADMAP.md](MASTER_SPRINT_ROADMAP.md) — scope, milestones, sprint order, and release gates.
2. [PRODUCT-001-semantic-bridge-vision-and-plan.md](PRODUCT-001-semantic-bridge-vision-and-plan.md) — product invariants and semantic model.
3. [ARCHITECTURE-001-bridge-sidecar-index-and-evidence-plan.md](ARCHITECTURE-001-bridge-sidecar-index-and-evidence-plan.md) — component boundaries and foundation backlog.
4. [RELEASE-001-release-1.0-acceptance-and-evidence-plan.md](RELEASE-001-release-1.0-acceptance-and-evidence-plan.md) — release requirements and evidence rules.
5. [ADR-000-fork-and-upstream-strategy.md](ADR-000-fork-and-upstream-strategy.md) — fork maintenance, branching, and versioning policy.
6. [BUILDING_CODEX_FORK.md](../../BUILDING_CODEX_FORK.md) — reproducible local macOS build and verification.

## Document status

| Document | Status | Next gate |
|---|---|---|
| `MASTER_SPRINT_ROADMAP` | Review candidate 1.0 | Updated from actual sprint evidence |
| `PRODUCT-001` | Approved 1.0 | Re-review on scope or invariant change |
| `ARCHITECTURE-001` | Draft for review 0.1 | `TEST-001` mapping and owners for D-01–D-04 |
| `RELEASE-001` | Draft for review 0.1 | `TEST-001` evidence manifest |
| `ADR-000` | Accepted | Revisit only if fork topology changes |

## Interim ownership

Until roles are delegated to separate maintainers, fork maintainer `Sergan2B` is the interim Product, Engine/Editor, Sidecar/Protocol, Codex Client, QA, Security, Platform, and Release owner. An owner may delegate a role without changing product scope. Independent security and release review is still required by the later Alpha, Beta, RC, and Stable gates.

## Change rules

- Update document status and the affected acceptance mapping in the same change.
- Record cross-component or compatibility decisions in an ADR before implementation depends on them.
- Do not mark an implementation gate complete without the evidence required by the parent document.
- Use relative links inside this directory and keep generated build artifacts out of Git.
